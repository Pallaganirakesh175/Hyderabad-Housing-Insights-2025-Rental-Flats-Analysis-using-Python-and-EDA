# Hyderabad-Housing-Insights-2025-Rental-Flats-Analysis-using-Python-and-EDA
I worked on an exciting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project using Python to uncover insights from the Hyderabad rental housing market.

Project Highlights:

Scraped real-time rental data from property listing platforms

Cleaned and structured the dataset (handling missing values, formatting, and conversions)

Conducted EDA to identify key market trends and patterns

Price is mainly driven by property size (sq.ft) and BHK count, while amenities and furnishing levels create premium segments

Brokerage costs scale with property size, becoming a hidden expense for tenants

Tech Stack: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn), BeautifulSoup (Web Scraping), CSV for structured storage

This project not only strengthened my data analysis and visualization skills but also gave me a deeper understanding of real estate rental market dynamics.
