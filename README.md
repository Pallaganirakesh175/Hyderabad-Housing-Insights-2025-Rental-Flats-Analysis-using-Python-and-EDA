# Hyderabad-Housing-Insights-2025-Rental-Flats-Analysis-using-Python-and-EDA
I worked on an exciting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project using Python to uncover insights from the Hyderabad rental housing market.

Project Highlights:

Scraped real-time rental data from property listing platforms

Cleaned and structured the dataset (handling missing values, formatting, and conversions)

Conducted EDA to identify key market trends and patterns

Key Insights:

3 BHK flats dominate the Hyderabad rental market

Kokapet, Kondapur, and the Financial District lead with the highest rental counts

Fully furnished homes command the highest rent, while semi-furnished units make up around 77% of the market

Price is mainly driven by property size (sq.ft) and BHK count, while amenities and furnishing levels create premium segments

Brokerage costs scale with property size, becoming a hidden expense for tenants

Tech Stack: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn), BeautifulSoup (Web Scraping), CSV for structured storage

This project not only strengthened my data analysis and visualization skills but also gave me a deeper understanding of real estate rental market dynamics.
